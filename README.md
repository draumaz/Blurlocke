# Blurlocke
- Android 10 used to have a feature where the currently-playing music [would have its art displayed zoomed and blurred as your lock screen wallpaper](https://www.androidpolice.com/album-art-wallpapers-should-never-have-been-removed-but-material-you-is-the-time-to-bring-it-back/).
- Google [removed this without warning](https://9to5google.com/2020/08/02/android-11-lockscreen-art) in a developer build of Android 11, leaving us in a world without album art lock screen...until now.

## required
- [KLWP Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.wallpaper.pro&hl=en_US&gl=US)
